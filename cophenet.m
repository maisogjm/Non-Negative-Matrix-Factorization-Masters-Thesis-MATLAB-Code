function c = cophenet(Z,Y)
%COPHENET Cophenetic coefficient.
%   C = COPHENET(Z,Y) computes the Cophenetic coefficient between the
%   distance of the cluster tree in Z and the distance in Y. Z is the
%   output of the function LINKAGE. Y is the output of the function
%   PDIST.
%
%   The Cophenetic coefficient is defined as
%   
%                    sum((Z(i,j)-z)*(Y(i,j)-y)) 
%                    i<j             
%       c =   -----------------------------------------
%             sqrt(sum((Z(i,j)-z)^2)*sum((Y(i,j)-y)^2))
%                  i<j               i<j
%
%           
%   Y(i,j) is the distance between observation i and j. y is mean(Y).
%   Z(i,j) is the distance between observation i and j at the combine
%   time and z = mean(Z).
